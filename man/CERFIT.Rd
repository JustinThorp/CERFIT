\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula to build CERFIT.  Categorical predictors must be listed as a factor. e.g., Y ~ x1 + x2 | treatment}

\item{data}{Data to grow a tree.}

\item{ntrees}{Number of Trees to grow}

\item{search}{Method to search through candidate splits}

\item{method}{For observational study data, method="observation";for randomized study data, method="RCT".}

\item{PropForm}{Method to estimate propensity score}

\item{split}{Impurity measure splitting statistic}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables to consider at each split}

\item{nsplit}{Number of cut points selected}

\item{nsplit.random}{Logical: indicates if process to select cut points are random}

\item{minsplit}{Number of observations required to continue growing tree}

\item{minbucket}{Number of observations required in each child node}

\item{maxdepth}{Maximum depth of tree}

\item{a}{Sigmoid approximation variable (for "sss" which is still under development)}

\item{sampleMethod}{Method to sample learning sample}

\item{useRes}{Logical indicator if you want to fit the CERFIT model to linear model residuals}

\item{scale.y}{Logical, standardize y when creating splits (For "sss" to increase stability)}
}
\value{
The fitted CERFIT model.
